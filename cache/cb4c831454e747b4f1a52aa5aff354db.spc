  encourage continued participation in the free software community.
  GPLv3 has improved termination provisions to codify this approach,
  giving developers one more reason to upgrade.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4474:"<p>Thanks to Android's commercial success, the kernel Linux, which is
released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, is
being distributed more than ever before.  Whenever someone distributes
GPL-covered software, they must follow a few conditions set forth in
the license.  These conditions try to give anyone who receives the
software both the legal permission and the practical tools necessary
to change and share the software themselves if they wish.</p>

<p>Not all of the companies that distribute Android heed these
conditions.  We've witnessed an uptick in GPL violation
reports&mdash;some convincing, others incomplete or
misinformed&mdash;against these vendors.  We generally can't pursue
these violations directly, because only copyright holders can enforce
free software licenses in most countries, and few Android devices use
FSF-copyrighted code.  However, people still seek out our opinions
about the relevant parts of the GPL, and that discussion has recently
turned to GPLv2's termination provisions.  Section 4 of the license
says, &ldquo;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we enforce the license of FSF-copyrighted software, we give
violators back the rights they had after they come into compliance.
In our experience, developers of Linux are happy to do the same.
Unfortunately, even if we assume they all would restore these rights,
it would be extremely difficult to have them all formally do so; there
are simply too many copyright holders involved, some of whom haven't
worked on the project in years or even decades.</p>

<p>When we wrote GPLv2 in 1991, we didn't imagine that a free software
project might have hundreds of copyright holders, making it so
difficult to get a violator's rights restored.  We want it to be easy
for a former violator to know that they're still allowed to change and
share the software; if they stop distribution because of legal
uncertainty, fewer people will have free software in the long run.
Hence, we created new <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#section8">termination provisions for GPLv3</a>.  These
terms offer violators a simple method to earn back the rights they
had.  Parties who violate the license have their rights restored
provisionally as soon as they come back into compliance, and
permanently if no copyright holders terminate those rights within
sixty days of the last violation.  Furthermore, first-time violators
will have their rights restored permanently if they come into
compliance within thirty days of receiving such notice.</p>

<p>GPLv3's approach has several advantages over GPLv2's.  By having the
license grant forgiveness by default, instead of terminating rights
permanently, it better matches our community's expectations and normal
compliance strategy.  It will be easier for violators to get their
rights restored by any copyright holders who do terminate rights,
because the notice will establish a clear way for the violator to get
in touch.  Finally, GPLv3's termination provisions don't sacrifice
anything we need: the license's conditions still do their best to
protect software freedom, and copyright holders will still be able to
legally enforce the license against parties that don't comply.</p>

<p>This is just one of many reasons
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">why GPLv3 is better than GPLv2</a>.  This change has already
given some companies the reassuring nudge they needed to start
distributing GPL-covered software, and we expect to see more of that
in the future.  When we give distributors a chance to rejoin the free
software community and fix any mistakes they might make&mdash;in stark
contrast to most proprietary software licenses&mdash;we get both
compliance and more allies.  GPLv3 improves on earlier versions of the
license by codifying that enforcement strategy.  For this reason and
others, we urge developers who are releasing projects under GPLv2 to
upgrade to GPLv3.  Companies that sell products that use Android can
help out by encouraging the developers of Linux to make the switch to
GPLv3.</p>

week that OpenOffice.org would become an official Apache project.
OpenOffice.org is an important piece of free software, and many of its
supporters suggest that this change will give them more control over
the project's future direction.  However, users and contributors
should be aware that, as part of this transition, it will become
easier for proprietary software developers to distribute
OpenOffice.org as nonfree software.</p>

<p>All Apache projects are distributed under the terms of the Apache
License.  This is a non-copyleft free software license; anybody who
receives the software can distribute it to others under nonfree terms.
Such a licensing strategy represents a significant policy change for
OpenOffice.org.  Previously, the software was distributed under the
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  The LGPL is a
weak copyleft license, so programs that merely link to the software
can be released under nonfree terms, but the software covered by the
LGPL must always be released, along with its source code, under the
LGPL's terms.  Free software developers are clearly comfortable with a
partial copyleft when it's appropriate; in numerous surveys of free
software projects, the LGPL is commonly listed as the second-most
popular license (after the GNU General Public License), or else
follows close behind.</p>

<p>While we do
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html">recommend the Apache License in specific situations</a>, we do
not believe it is the best choice for software like OpenOffice.org.
This situation calls for copyleft, because the gains free software
stands to make from a non-copyleft license don't justify giving a
handout to proprietary software developers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's a ready alternative for people who want to work
with a productivity suite that does more to protect their freedom:
LibreOffice.  Anybody who's comfortable with OpenOffice.org will find
a familiar interface and feature set in LibreOffice, because it was
originally based on the same source code.  Since September 2010,
numerous contributors have been working to improve the software, and
the project's legal steward, The Document Foundation, is committed to
keeping it licensed under the LGPL.</p>

<p>LibreOffice's commitment to user freedom does not end at the license
of its source code. Like OpenOffice.org, the software's built-in
extension manager makes it easy to add new features, but unlike
OpenOffice.org, its <a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List">extension database</a> only lists
<a href="/news/fsf-launches-free-software-extension-listing-for-openoffice.org">add-ons that are under a free license</a>. OpenOffice.org
points to a database that includes proprietary extensions, and doesn't
always provide clear licensing information.  This approach to extensions risks turning free
software into a platform for the development and promotion of proprietary
extras.</p>

<p>Anybody who plans to use or contribute to one of these productivity
suites should understand how these policies affect them, and consider
which better complement their own goals. While both pass the most
important test of being free software, we recommend LibreOffice
because its policies do significantly more to promote the cause of
free software.</p>

<p>The new edition of <em>Free Software, Free Society</em> features a number of
improvements: it has both new essays and updated versions of classic
pieces on the GNU Project and free software. Part of the book is
devoted to the issue of language framing and its significance in the
survival of free software; another discusses the traps that erode
computer-user freedoms, and a third urges software users to choose
civic values and community over convenience. This edition also adds an
index, and a new introduction by FSF licensing compliance engineer
Brett Smith.</p> 
 
<p>Also now in print is GNU Press's second edition of <em>Free as in
Freedom</em>, Sam Williams's biography of Richard Stallman, revised and
annotated by Stallman. Williams released the first edition of the book
under the GNU Free Documentation License, thus encouraging others to
modify and improve upon the work. While the second edition is actually
a new joint work, it follows in this original spirit. "I have aimed,"
writes Stallman, "to make this edition combine the advantages of my
knowledge and Williams's interviews and outside viewpoint." Stallman
preserves all of Williams's relevant quotes and most of his personal
impressions, and contrasts them with his own.</p> 

<img src="http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-news.png" alt="Free as in Freedom" class="imgright" />
 
<p>These books will be available electronically as PDFs but will notably
<em>not</em> be distributed in the Amazon Kindle format or for any other
proprietary ebook reading platform, because of the Digital
Restrictions Management (DRM) those systems impose on users. "This
malicious device," says Stallman, "is designed to attack the
traditional freedoms of readers: There's the freedom to acquire a book
anonymously, paying cash &mdash; impossible with the Kindle for all
well-known recent books. There's the freedom to give, lend, or sell a
book to anyone you wish &mdash; blocked by DRM and unjust licenses. Then
there's the freedom to keep a book &mdash; denied by a back door for remote
deletion of books."</p> 
 
<p>Proceeds from the sale of these books will help fund the FSF's
campaigns to defend and promote computer users' rights &mdash; including
its work against DRM via the <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org">DefectiveByDesign.org</a> campaign.</p>

and the Award for Projects of Social Benefit.</p> 
 
<p>The Award for the Advancement of Free Software is given annually to an
individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and
development of free software, through activities that accord with the
spirit of free software.</p> 
 
<p>This year, it was given to Rob Savoye. Savoye is a long-time free
software hacker, who has worked on GNU and other free software for
over 20 years. He has contributed to dozens of projects including GCC,
GDB, DejaGnu, Newlib, Libgloss, Cygwin, eCos, Expect, multiple major
GNU/Linux distributions, and One Laptop Per Child. Savoye has led the
effort to produce a free software Flash player, <a href="http://www.gnashdev.org">Gnash</a>. This work
has enabled free software users to avoid dependency on a pervasive
piece of proprietary software. Rob is also CTO and founder of Open
Media Now, a nonprofit dedicated to producing a freely licensed media
infrastructure.</p> 
 
<p>Savoye joins a distinguished list of previous winners:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>2009 John Gilmore</li> 
<li>2008 Wietse Venema</li> 
<li>2007 Harald Welte</li>

<li>2000 Brian Paul</li> 
<li>1999 Miguel de Icaza</li> 
<li>1998 Larry Wall</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The Award for Projects of Social Benefit recognizes a project that
intentionally and significantly benefits society through collaboration
to accomplish an important social task.</p> 
 
<p>This year, the award went to the <a href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a>. Using free software, Tor
has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world to experience
freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in
control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal
in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt.</p> 
 
<p>Tor Project executive director Andrew Lewman was present to accept the
award on the project's behalf.</p> 
 
<p>Tor joins an impressive list of previous winners:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>2009 Internet Archive</li> 
<li>2008 Creative Commons</li> 
<li>2007 Groklaw</li> 
<li>2006 Sahana Disaster Management System</li> 
<li>2005 Wikipedia</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Stallman and the awards committee also gave special acknowledgment to
the work of Adrian Hands, who passed away on February 3rd of this
year. Adrian suffered from ALS, and was unable to use a keyboard --
but using a Morse code device and deep dedication, he spent some of
the last days of his life writing <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78514#c19">code to improve the usability of
GNOME for himself and others.</a></p> 
 
<p>This year's award committee was: Suresh Ramasubramanian, Peter H.
Salus, Wietse Venema, Raj Mathur, Hong Feng, Andrew Tridgell, Jonas
Oberg, Vernor Vinge, Richard Stallman, Fernanda G. Weiden and Harald
Welte.</p>

<p>The appointment follows the departure of Peter T. Brown, who has been
the Foundation's executive director since 2005. Brown shares his
reflections on the change in a blog post at
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/peterb">http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/peterb</a>.</p>

<p>Sullivan, who has worked at the FSF since 2003 and has been the
operations manager since 2007, said, "I'm looking forward to working
closely with FSF president Richard Stallman and our board to advance
the goals of the free software movement. I'm very thankful to Peter
for his effective leadership in our advocacy campaigns and in our
efforts to build resources for free software."</p>

<p>About the challenges and opportunities ahead, Sullivan added, "I'm
especially interested in our projects to promote free software
adoption in public and educational institutions, in doing what we can
to make GNU and the rest of the free software movement a welcoming, positive place for
everyone, and in standing up to bullying from companies who think they
should be able to take freedom from individuals in order to make a
buck &mdash; such as Apple and Microsoft locking free software out of their
mobile application stores; Sony prosecuting people for installing free
software on hardware in their own homes; and Adobe, MPEG-LA and others
trying to erect toll gates at the entrance to the free Web. The FSF
will continue the work it has been doing for over 25 years, to move us
toward a free society with free software."</p>

enacting DMCA-like anti-circumvention legislation, establishing
criminal penalties for specific kinds of infringement, and maintaining
several overbearing enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<img src="/campaigns/acta/copyrightlock.jpg" class="imgright" alt="" />

<p>ACTA was largely drafted in secret between countries with the world's
largest economies, with input from large copyright and trademark
holders who stand to benefit from all this legislation at our expense.
As more information about the terms of the agreement began to leak, we
published Richard Stallman's <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/acta/acta-declaration">"Firm, Simple Declaration Against
ACTA"</a> and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/acta/why-acta-declaration">accompanying essay</a>.  Since then, more than
4,700 of you have signed it.  Thanks for your support!</p>

<p>Now the drafting process is finished, and the countries who negotiated
it are now looking to sign it.  Some of the provisions in the final
text are not as bad as earlier drafts&mdash;but that doesn't mean the
agreement is acceptable.  We need to take this opportunity to demand
the freedoms we deserve.  As Stallman explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... where there have been previous changes for the worse, lauding
  the status quo tends to legitimize them. ... To confront a further
  assault by presenting the status quo as ideal means we stop fighting
  to reverse them. It means that our adversaries need only propose a
  further affront to our rights to gain our acceptance of their last
  affront.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of making the status quo our ideal, we should demand
  positive changes to recover freedoms already lost.</p>

<p>The US Trade Representative is requesting comments from US citizens
and organizations about signing ACTA.  Now, we've added your voice to
ours.  The FSF has <a href="http://static.fsf.org/nosvn/2011-01-ustr-acta.pdf">submitted a letter</a> encouraging the US,
and all countries, to reject the agreement and instead focus on
repealing copyright and trademark laws that unfairly support large
owners, citing the 4,700 signatures that Stallman's declaration
received.  You can help even more:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you haven't already, please <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/acta/acta-declaration">sign the declaration</a>.
The USTR may check to verify the number of signatures we mentioned

<h3>Sample Letter</h3>

  <p>Stanford K. McCoy <br />
  Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Intellectual Property and Innovation <br />
  Office of the United States Trade Representative <br />
  600 17th St NW <br />

  <p>Re: Comments on ACTA (Docket no. USTR-2010-0014)</p>
  
  <p>Dear Mr. McCoy:</p>
  
  <p>I am writing to urge the United States not to sign ACTA.  The
  agreement would impose unethically strict extensions to copyright
  law in other countries, and increased criminal penalties for
  infringement here.  It mandates a number of enforcement mechanisms
  that unjustly benefit copyright and trademark holders at the
  expense of individual liberties.  It would also create new
  obstacles to repealing problematic US laws like the Digital
  Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
  
  <p>Now that computers are available to many, it's easier than ever
  for people to share information and cultural works with each
  other.  Our laws should allow and encourage them to do so.  We
  stand to benefit from less enforcement of copyright and trademark
  laws&mdash;not more.  ACTA is a step in the wrong direction.  No
  country should sign it.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html">Most GNU/Linux distributions</a> directly or virtually include
proprietary software.  To promote development and use of totally
free distros, the FSF publishes precise <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">criteria for
GNU/Linux distributions</a> to fully respect users' freedom.</p> 
 
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">Several distributions</a> have stepped up to meet the criteria. These
distributions, including <a href="http://trisquel.info">Trisquel</a> and <a href="http://gnewsense.org">gNewSense</a>, have committed to
distributing and recommending only free software, and have a policy of
treating anything inconsistent with this as a critical bug.</p> 
 
<p>With Squeeze, Debian has moved one key category of proprietary
software which is included in most other common GNU/Linux
distributions &mdash; so-called firmware "blobs" in the kernel Linux &mdash; out
of its default package repository and into the nonfree section.</p> 
 
<p>Debian has a policy of only distributing free software in its default
repository, but has made an exception for the nonfree software
distributed with its primary kernel &mdash; until now.</p> 
 
<p>We cheer for the Debian activists who campaigned for this change and
achieved it. We hope other distributions will follow this lead, and
that they and Debian will take on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html">remaining challenges to
become fully free</a> system distributions.</p>

<h4>Award for the Advancement of Free Software</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software is presented annually by FSF president Richard Stallman to an individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and development of free software, through activities that accord with the spirit of free software.</p>

<p>Last year, <strong>John Gilmore</strong> was recognized with the Award for the Advancement of Free Software for his contributions to network security. Gilmore joined a prestigious list of previous winners including Wietse Venema, Harald Welte, Ted Ts'o, Andrew Tridgell, Theo de Raadt, Alan Cox, Larry Lessig, Guido van Rossum, Brian Paul, Miguel de Icaza and Larry Wall.</p>

<h4>Award for Projects of Social Benefit</h4>

<p>Nominations are also open for the 2010 Award for Projects of Social Benefit. The Social Benefit award recognizes a project that intentionally and significantly benefits society through collaboration to accomplish an important social task.</p>

<p>Last year, <strong>The Internet Archive</strong> received this award, in recognition of its work to foster a growing body of creative, educational and scientific works that can be shared and built upon by others, and to raise awareness of the harm inflicted by increasingly restrictive copyright regimes.</p>

<p>Previous winners have included Creative Commons, Groklaw, the Sahana project, and Wikipedia.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>In the case of both awards, previous winners are not eligible for nomination, but renomination of other previous nominees is encouraged. Only individuals are eligible for nomination for the Advancement of Free Software Award (not projects), and only projects can be nominated for the Social Benefit Award (not individuals).</p>

<p>The award committee has not been finalized, but the last year's award committee was composed of: Suresh Ramasubramanian (Chair), Peter H. Salus, Raj Mathur, Hong Feng, Andrew Tridgell, Jonas Oberg, Verner Vinge, Richard Stallman, and Fernanda G. Weiden.</p>

<p>Please send your nominations to <a href="mailto:award-nominations@gnu.org">award-nominations@gnu.org</a>, on or before Wednesday, 16 February 2011. Please submit nominations in the following format:</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> The Boards of our respective organizations are concerned that the proposed recipient of Novell's patent portfolio, CPTN, represents a serious threat to the growing use of free/libre and open source software (FLOSS) throughout business, government, academia, and non-profit organizations worldwide.  The founders and leaders of CPTN have a long history of opposing and misrepresenting the value of FLOSS, which is at the heart of Web infrastructure and of many of the most widely used software products and services.  The sole or leading competition for several products from the CPTN principals are FLOSS, as described below.  We urge the Department of Justice to recognize the significance of FLOSS and to investigate the threat posed to it by the CPTN transaction.</p>

<p><em>Detail:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>FLOSS has emerged as one of the most liberating, competitive, and innovative developments of the software industry.  In the enterprise, it runs some of the largest websites in the world, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, as well as some of the largest stock exchanges, including NYSE/Euronext, the Deutsche B&ouml;rse, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </p></li>
<li><p>As a practical and moral philosophy, a development model, and a way of managing copyrights and mitigating the risks associated with patents, FLOSS has become a first-class citizen in the minds of IT buyers, and a credible competitor to traditional proprietary software, even when such software vendors command monopoly-like market power.</p></li>
<li><p>Progress has been equally dramatic in the public sector: in its most recent survey, the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS) has cataloged more than 350 governmental policies promoting FLOSS, an increase of nearly 50% in the past two years<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>. </p></li>
<li><p>The proposed CPTN transaction represents a potentially new, and unprecedented threat to software freedom:</p>

<ol class="latin-list">
<li><p>CPTN Principals have acknowledged that the GNU/Linux operating system specifically, and FLOSS in general, represents the major competitive force to their business.  Microsoft and Oracle both call out FLOSS as a competitive threat in their most recent 10-K filings<a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, <a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>CPTN principals have substantial market power in operating systems (Microsoft, Apple, Oracle), middleware (Microsoft, Oracle), and virtualization and network storage (Microsoft, Oracle, EMC)</p></li>
<li><p>FLOSS is a substantial competitor in operating systems (GNU/Linux and Android), middleware (Apache, JBoss), and virtualization and network storage (KVM, Xen hypervisor)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The acquisition of the patents of a major distributor of GNU/Linux has been shrouded in secrecy.  Secrecy is customary in business transactions, but secrecy can also be used to hide nefarious intentions.  Given the potential for collusion between these competitors to reduce competition amongst them and to harm competition that exists in the marketplace today, competition would be better served by the Department of Justice thoroughly investigating the facts and evidence concerning this transaction, rather than giving them the benefit of the commercial doubt:</p>

<ol class="latin-list">
<li><p>Will secrecy be used to spread more patent fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)?</p></li>
<li><p>Will the CPTN principals decide strategically who will be offered which patents, thereby choosing amongst themselves who will be allowed to compete?  And on what terms?</p></li>
<li><p>Will the patents be sold to non-practicing entities (NPEs) which can create havoc for FLOSS without risking the adverse reaction of the market if a practicing entity were to sue directly?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The creation of CPTN represents a major disruption to the competitive landscape.  Whereas Novell was sincere in promoting and participating in FLOSS development and had an incentive to maintain their patent assets as a defensive portfolio, CPTN has all the motives and opportunity to do the opposite.  That is, they have no incentive to support FLOSS as a competitive alternative to proprietary software.  CPTN creates a cover to launch patent attacks against companies delivering solutions based on FLOSS while creating for each principal a measure of plausible deniability that the patent attack was not their idea.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For all these reasons, we urge the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice to investigate the CPTN transaction thoroughly and consider appropriate remedies to address the concerns raised above.  Both the OSI and the FSF would be happy to lend support or provide any additional information that may be requested.</p>

<h3>Appendix - Contextual Primer</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>FLOSS is a real asset representing real investments that deserve fair protection under the law:</p>

<ol class="latin-list">
<li><p>Over 1B source lines of code (SLOC) have been created with FLOSS as of 2008<a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>David Wheeler argues that 6.6M SLOC = $1B in development cost, hence</p>

<ol class="roman-list">
<li><p>the Linux kernel (over 6.6M SLOC) cost more than $1B<a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>the Fedora 9 GNU/Linux distribution (205M SLOC<a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>) cost more than $31B</p></li>
<li><p>1B SLOC in 2008 has $150B of imputed cost using conventional methods of production.  This is an extremely large economic resource, and one which is free to all in the world who wish to read, modify, share, and commercially redistribute it.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>FLOSS was crucial to the development, architecture, and infrastructure of several world-changing technologies, including the Internet, Google, and Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>FLOSS is also important to the public sector: when he was President of Brazil, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva was awarded the highest honor by the ITU for Brazil's progress in solving the digital divide, and in his acceptance speech he credited &ldquo;software livre&rdquo; (free/libre and open source software) for that success<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>FLOSS delivers many tens of billions of IT value in USD and EUR every year<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>FLOSS is not &ldquo;non-commercial&rdquo; - rather, it is software where revenues are generated from the delivery of value around the software rather than by controlling access to the software. This switch away from artificial scarcity as the only means for monetization liberates developers from many places to synchronize overlapping interests and collaborate around a open source code &ldquo;commons&rdquo; to sustain the wealth-creating vehicle they jointly enjoy. This liberty is widely described as one of the attributes of &ldquo;software freedom&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>A 2008 survey funded by the US Department of Homeland Security analyzed 250 FLOSS programs<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> and found that on average, FOSS had 60 times lower defect density than the industry average.  In 2009, surveying 280 FOSS programs<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>, the survey found a 33% reduction of defect density, increasing the quality to 80 times lower defect density than the industry average.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality problems remain a major reason why on average the global $3.5T/year cost of IT includes $1T/year of project write-offs and remediation, and why the $1.5T enterprise IT market includes $500B of project write-offs and remediation.  Whereas &ldquo;lower cost&rdquo; had been the #1 reason for adopting FLOSS in the enterprise for the past four years, quality compared to proprietary software was the #1 reason given for choosing FLOSS<a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One leading firm that provides industry analysis has predicted that more than 80% of all enterprise IT organizations will use FLOSS by 2012<a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>, and a leading enterprise IT practitioner has already measured a 78% adoption rate within their customer base<a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>.  Measured by revenue, its market share remains very small compared with the revenues of proprietary software (or compared with Principals of the CPTN for that matter).  However, the fact that it is being evaluated and adopted on a very widespread basis, and that its growth rate compared to the software industry average proves that it is presently thriving as a competitor in the marketplace today.</p></li>
<li><p>A paper presented at ACM ICSE (Association for Computational Machinery International Conference on Software Engineering) in 2000 that was judged &ldquo;Most Influential Paper 10 Years Later&rdquo;<a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> argued that the &ldquo;long tail&rdquo; of FLOSS helped explain why  projects like the Apache web server could &ldquo;deliver sooner, with fewer bugs, that themselves were fixed more rapidly&rdquo;.  By its nature, and in contrast to proprietary software, it encourages universal participation and unfettered innovation.  Its developers rarely hold back features to gain strategic advantage (because it is so easy for other community developers to simply add such features themselves).  Thus, the very purpose of asserting a software patent is contradictory to achieving the kind of quality and innovation seen in FLOSS.  Many argue that for this reason alone--the provable point that patents deter rather than encourage innovation--is reason enough to disallow them in the field of software, or at least to disallow their assertion against FLOSS.</p></li>
<li><p>There are programmers (and institutions) who care more about absolute quality and security of software than relative profitability or competitive market share.  Many programmers who participate in free and open source software communities say they do so because they believe that the development model is simply the best and most innovative in the world.<a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>  For them, patent assertions (especially vague patent assertions) are a disincentive to participate in FLOSS development.</p></li>
<li><p>There are programmers (and institutions) who care more about software freedom than relative profitability or competitive market share.  Many programmers who participate in free and open source software communities say they do so because they are deeply committed to the moral principle that a person should be free to share the fruits of their labors with their community, and that productive work protected by copyrights should not be subject to rescission based on patents.<a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>  For them, patent assertions (especially vague patent assertions) are a disincentive to participate in FLOSS development.</p></li>

H.264 video codec from its browsers, in favor of the WebM codec
that they recently made free.  Since then, there's been a lot of
discussion about how this change will affect the Web going forward, as
HTML5 standards like the video tag mature.</p>

<p>We applaud Google for this change; it's a positive step for free
software, its users, and everyone who uses the Web.  For a while now,
watching video on the Web has been fraught with peril.  Most of it is
delivered with Flash, which is proprietary, nonstandard software.
Free software alternatives like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">GNU Gnash</a> are available, but the
user experience isn't always as seamless as it ought to be.</p>

<p>When work began on the next version of the HTML standard, HTML5, work
on video delivery and playback was a priority.  But while everybody
agrees on how the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag should look, there's no agreement
about how that video should be encoded.  Microsoft and Apple support
H.264; Mozilla and Opera support WebM and Ogg Theora.  For a while,
Google has been supporting all of these codecs&mdash;but now it's made
a bold move to support free standards and drop H.264.</p>

<p>That's good news, because if Web video standardizes on H.264, that
won't be any better than the situation today.  H.264 is a
patent-encumbered codec; the MPEG LA organization requires developers
who implement it to agree to a patent license.  This license is
fundamentally incompatible with software freedom.  It requires
developers to restrict how their software can be used, and to collect
royalties in many situations.</p>

<p>In order to make sure the Web stays free for everyone, we need a free
codec to prevail as the de facto standard with HTML5.  WebM can be
that codec: Google provides a patent license with the standard that is
compatible with free software licenses, and even got the development
ball rolling by releasing a free implementation.  They're also
promoting it aggressively, and their decision to drop H.264 is one
more step in that direction.</p>

<p>Some reaction to Google's move has suggested that it represents a step
back for standards on the Web, because H.264 is supported by more
hardware and software.  Those comments represent a fundamental
misunderstanding of the vision of the Web as free and unencumbered.
We can only be free if we reject data formats that are restricted by
patents.</p>

<p>But the issue's not settled yet.  Now's the time for everyone to take
action and make sure that WebM actually sees the adoption we need.  To
that end, we've signed up as a <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/about/supporters/#foundations">supporter of the WebM
Project</a>, and we encourage other foundations and
organizations to join us&mdash;write to <a href="&#109;a&#x69;&#x6C;to:&#119;&#x65;&#x62;&#x6D;&#97;&#115;&#x74;&#x65;&#114;&#64;&#x77;&#x65;&#x62;&#109;&#112;&#114;&#111;je&#99;&#x74;&#46;&#111;&#x72;&#x67;">&#119;&#x65;&#x62;&#x6D;&#97;&#115;&#x74;&#x65;&#114;&#64;&#x77;&#x65;&#x62;&#109;&#112;&#114;&#111;je&#99;&#x74;&#46;&#111;&#x72;&#x67;</a> to
learn how.  Today, we're also urging Web site operators to distribute
videos in the WebM format, and abandon H.264.</p>

<p>Soon, we'll revamp our PlayOgg campaign into <a href="http://playfreedom.org/">PlayFreedom</a>, where
we'll be focusing on more ways that everyone can encourage WebM
adoption.  You can sign up now to learn more about how you can help.

Network. The Network aims to expand the availability of professional
educational courses and materials covering the concepts and applications of free software and free standards.

The learning materials are all
published under a free license and can be accessed by anyone, but
learners enrolled in the FTA will be guided by professional teaching
staff from one of the three participating universities. The FTA aims to enable IT professionals, students, teachers and decision makers to
undertake accredited professional education modules in free software
studies.</p>

<p>One of the FTA objectives is to establish a strong relationship with the free software community and to turn the FTA course materials into an essential reference. The FTA seeks to educate and promote the adoption of free technologies without losing sight of the free software community's core purpose of freedom and social transformation.</p>

<p>Wouter Tebbens, president of the Free Knowledge Institute and director of the FTA, explains: "We are building this master's programme on free software with the support from relevant organisations and community members. And in this sense it is an honour for us to have the support of Richard Stallman and the FSF. We hope to be of use to the community and we invite the community to participate in our courses and review our materials."</p>

<p>Richard Stallman, leader of the free software movement and president of the Free Software Foundation, said, "The FTA course materials teach people to use GNU/Linux; more than that, it teaches them to recognize why this is important."</p>

<p>Details of the Partnership:</p>

<ul>
<li>The FSF will provide special video guest lectures in FTA courses.</li>
<li>The FSF will encourage volunteers to collaborate in the maintenance
of existing materials and the production of new courses.</li>
<li>The FTA will provide the FSF Associate Membership
(<a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/">http://www.fsf.org/associate/</a>) with 30 discount vouchers for FTA
courses each trimester.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enrollment for 2011 courses is now open, and students can register at

<h3>About the Free Technology Academy</h3>

<p>A Consortium formed by the Open University of Catalonia (Spain), the
Open University of the Netherlands and the University of Agder (Norway)
and led by the Free Knowledge Institute (FKI), the FTA has started up -
with support from the EC's Lifelong Learning Programme - an
international educational programme on Free Software. The courses are
taught completely online in a virtual campus based on the Campus Project
interoperability framework.</p>

<p>Following the Free Software and Open Educational Resources movements,
all learning materials are freely available through the Internet. The
use of Free Software (also referred to as Open Source software or Libre
Software) is rapidly expanding in governmental and private
organisations. However, still only a limited number of ICT
professionals, teachers and decision makers have sufficient knowledge
and expertise in these new fields. The Free Technology Academy aims to
address this gap by providing high level courses that fit into larger
Master Programmes at the participating universities.</p>

The FSF seeks both to obtain feedback on the criteria, and raise interest in the program among hardware manufacturers.  Ultimately, the FSF plans to promote an endorsement mark to be carried on  products that the FSF endorses.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4316:"<p>&ldquo;The desire to own a computer or device and have full control over it, to know that you are not being spied on or tracked, to run any software you wish without asking permission, and to share with friends without worrying about Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)&mdash;these are the desires of millions of people who care about the future of technology and our society.  Unfortunately, hardware manufacturers have until now relied on close cooperation with proprietary software companies that demanded control over their users. As citizens and their customers, we need to promote our desires for a new class of hardware&mdash;hardware that anyone can support because it respects your freedom,&rdquo; said Peter Brown, executive director of the FSF.</p>

<p>The FSF's criteria seek to cover all aspects of user interaction with and control of a device: they say the hardware must run free software on every layer that is user upgradeable, allow the user to modify that software, support free data formats, be fully usable with free tools, and more.</p>

<p>FSF license compliance engineer Brett Smith said, &ldquo;Every software component needed to produce endorsable hardware is now available.  We have several GNU/Linux distributions that only include free software, and are completely functional on the right hardware. We have the LinuxLibre kernel that does not include nonfree microcode.  And we have cutting edge mobile platforms like Android and MeeGo that are based on free software. In the past we've spoken to manufacturers who were interested in making free software-friendly hardware, but they worried about connecting with customers.  With our endorsement mark and the strong criteria that back it, we plan to bridge that gap and demonstrate to manufacturers that they stand to gain plenty by making hardware that respects people's freedom instead of curtailing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The initial set of guidelines are available on the LibrePlanet wiki, at
<a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Hardware/Endorsement_criteria">http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Hardware/Endorsement_criteria</a>.  The FSF welcomes feedback on the wiki discussion page, including suggestions for improvements to the criteria, as well as ideas and art submissions for an endorsement mark.</p>

<p>Hardware manufacturers interested in endorsement should contact <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#x6C;&#105;&#x63;&#101;&#x6E;&#115;i&#x6E;&#103;&#64;&#x66;&#115;&#102;&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#x6C;&#105;&#x63;&#101;&#x6E;&#115;i&#x6E;&#103;&#64;&#x66;&#115;&#102;&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

software powerful and reliable, focuses on development models, and

<p>Trisquel, one of the distributions recommended by the Free Software Foundation for its commitment to freedom, decided to celebrate Software Freedom Day by releasing Trisquel 4.0 LTS, "codename[d] 'Taranis'" after the <a href="http://trisquel.info/en/trisquel-40-lts-taranis-strikes">Celtic god of Thunder.</a> The LTS stands for "Long Term Support." This is their second LTS release, and they promise three years of support. </p> 
 
<p>Taranis was based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, but "contains just free software." Netinstall images are available for servers. The standard image contains support for English and Spanish, but they will be releasing a DVD with a larger translation set at some point in the future. Trisquel can be found at <a href="http://trisquel.info/en/trisquel-40-lts-taranis-strikes">http://trisquel.info/en/trisquel-40-lts-taranis-strikes</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Apple doesn't go upstream</h3> 
 
<p>In the past, Apple contributed Objective C support to the GNU Compiler Collection, with copyright for the changes assigned to the Free Software Foundation.  Recently, however, Apple has made new changes to GCC that it says it will not contribute upstream.</p> 
 
<p>Chief architect of Apple's compiler group, Chris Lattner, said that whatever changes Apple makes to its existing assigned GCC code will continue to be available for upstream. However, no other GCC code of Apple's, including LLVM-GCC, will be contributed. On the matter, Mr. Lattner <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2010-09/msg00132.html">said on the GCC project mailing list</a>, "Apple does not have an internal process to assign code to the FSF anymore. I would focus on the code that is already assigned to the FSF."</p> 

<h3>Europeans &mdash; stop unfair advertising! Get your government to promote free PDF readers!</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is <a href="http://www.fsfe.org/campaigns/pdfreaders/pdfreaders.en.html">calling on all Europeans to seek out advertisements for proprietary PDF readers</a> on their government's websites, and report them. In addition, FSFE has prepared a petition demanding an end to such advertising practices, and encourages the public to sign it.</p>

<p>When government websites encourage visitors to use Adobe Acrobat Reader and other proprietary software, they needlessly encourage citizens to throw away their freedom &mdash; yet free software PDF readers exist for all major operating systems.</p>

<p>The hunt began on September 13th, and will continue until October 17th 2010.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:5:{s:9:"publisher";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"No publisher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"mollydb";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"rights";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2010-11-05T13:42:32Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"type";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"News Item";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:64;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 02:08:05 GMT";s:6:"server";s:66:"Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) DAV/2 SVN/1.5.1 mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Fri, 16 Sep 2011 02:00:04 GMT";s:4:"etag";s:30:"acdbe-150a9-4ad055a0bb100-gzip";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"26985";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:12:"content-type";s:15:"application/xml";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20090627192103";}
