<p>At the Software Freedom Law Center, we do our internal accounting with free software. We had been using John Wiegley's <a href="http://www.ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a> for quite some time, and now we are also using Simon Michael's <a href="http://hledger.org/">hledger</a>.</p>
<p>We log most of our transactions either through manual entry in hledger-web (the hledger web interface) or import from .csv files via <code>hledger convert</code>. hledger can read comma-separated values from a file you might retrieve from a financial institution, and outputs entries in ledger format according to a set of rules that you specify. In some cases the data quality is poor enough that we do some preprocessing before feeding it to hledger.</p>
<p>Since we have no need for a large database-backed ERP system, we can take advantage of the benefits of the plain-text ledger format, and view reports from ledger, hledger, and hledger-web. We also plan to automate the generation of spreadsheets from the ledger entries.</p>
<p>There are some features we would like to see in or accompanying hledger-web: interactive CSV conversion, a VCS backend (through Data.FileStore), per-transaction atomic edits, tracking of which user made which changes, and the ability to intelligently deduplicate transactions.</p>
<p>If you know Haskell and would like to help us out, please take a look at this <a href="http://hledger.org/DEVELOPMENT.html">guide</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oscon.com/">OSCON</a> is probably the single largest annual gathering of free software developers in the world, so it's always a good opportunity for SFLC to catch up with the projects we work with and to make new friends in the community. I only got to spend two days at OSCON 2011, but in that time I met and talked shop (and microbrews and vegan donuts) with lots of folks who are making impressive contributions to free software. I also got to talk about <a href="http://softwarefreedom.org/events/2011/oscon-legal-basics/">Legal Basics for Developers</a> with <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gnomg/">Karen Sandler</a> to a fantastic and engaged audience.</p>

<p>The audio and slides from our talk are available in <a href="http://softwarefreedom.org/podcast/2011/aug/16/Episode-0x16-Legal-Basics-for-Developers/">this week's episode</a> of <a href="http://faif.us/">Free as in Freedom</a>, Karen's biweekly oggcast with <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/">Bradley Kuhn</a> of the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. While we didn't get through nearly all of the topics on the slides, we talked about fundamental trademark, copyright, and corporate issues that all free software developers should be aware of. We also answered some excellent and challenging questions from the audience; we didn't have the foresight to repeat those questions, so they're not audible on the recording, but even so our answers should be understandable and informative.</p>

<p>It was a busy week for my co-presenter Karen: she was given an <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gnomg/2011/07/31/oscon-report-part-1/">Open Source Award</a> for her excellent work at SFLC and the <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a> and she gave an superb <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/gnomg/2011/08/02/oscon-report-part-2/">keynote speech</a> about her <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2010/transparent-medical-devices.html">advocacy work related to medical devices software</a>, <a href="http://gnome3.org/">GNOME 3</a>, and the importance of software user freedom. Karen has been a great colleague and mentor to me at SFLC and I'm thrilled to see her work recognized.</p>

<p>In addition to my talk with Karen, I had the pleasure of meeting (among many others) <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a> (Linux power management hacker and GPL activist) and David Mirza and Bruce Leidl of <a href="http://subgraph.com/">Subgraph</a> (a Montreal startup building Vega, a free software website security-testing framework), trading notes with <a href="http://www.haynesandboone.com/Van_Lindberg/">Van Lindberg</a> (a very sharp free software lawyers in private practice), and of course trolling the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Richard_Fontana">usual</a> <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/">suspects</a>. And I fell deeper in love with <a href="http://www.ifc.com/portlandia/">Portland, OR</a>, where OSCON <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/oscon-2010-returning-to-portland-after-brief-jaunt-to-san-jose">returned in 2010</a> after O'Reilly was duly reprimanded for holding OSCON 2009 in dull San Jose.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who came to the talk and to O'Reilly for accepting our talk and hosting a great event! I'm already looking forward to next year.</p>

The application discloses &quot;gaming systems, instant messaging protocols that transmit audio, Skype and Skype-like applications, meeting software, video conferencing software, and the like&quot; as technologies that can use this method.

<p>SFLC is introducing
our <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">redesigned website</a>
today! We hope you like the new look. While the content is largely
unaffected, we've made some improvements to the information design to
make the content easier to access and understand. (Take a look at our
new <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/">publications</a>
page for an example.) We also changed our default content license to
Creative
Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/legalcode">Attribution-ShareAlike
3.0</a> (formerly
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/legalcode">Attribution-NoDerivs</a>).</p>

<p>On the backend, we're still using the excellent free web
framework <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> running
on top of the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP
Server</a>. The new design brings the frontend up to date with
emerging web standards, including HTML5. If you're using a modern,
standards-compliant web browser
(like <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox 4</a>), you
might notice this in subtle ways, like in some of
the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/about/colophon.html#fonts">free
fonts</a> we're using.</p>

<p>We hope this redesign to be the beginning of an evolution, rather than
a one-time change.  We will continue looking for ways to make our
content more useful and more accessible to you.  To do that, we need
your help! Please <a href="mailto:info@softwarefreedom.org">let
us know</a> if you can't find something you're looking for, or if
there's anything you'd like to see on our site that's not there.  And
of course the tires always need kicking&mdash;if you notice anything
broken or any invalid HTML, tell us about that too.</p>

<p>We applaud the rejection by Judge Denny Chin of the Google Books class action settlement with authors and publishers regarding the digitization of books. SFLC <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2009/sep/08/sflc-objects-google-book-settlement/">filed a letter</a> with the court on behalf of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and author Karl Fogel, urging the court to reject the settlement as it was last proposed and asking the court to consider the impact of the settlement upon members of the class who have distributed their works under Free licenses.</p>

<p>Judge Chen cited the objections of the class members as a key reason for the rejection. In our own objection, we pointed out that the settlement's attempt to balance commercial interests in publication allowed freely licensed books to be distributed without regard for their terms, undermining the community’s unifying values - a harm which could not be addressed a royalty arrangement.  We further pointed out that the settlement in essence would replaced the United States Congress as the entity responsible for devising copyright law.  As Judge Chin writes in his opinion today, "the matter is best left for Congress."</p>

<p>SFLC is pleased to provide a legal voice to clients like the FSF to defend software freedom and Free licenses generally. </p>

Please email any comments on this entry to <a href="mailto:Mishi@softwarefreedom.org">&lt;Mishi@softwarefreedom.org&gt;</a>.</i></p>
<p>According to the Government of India, private service providers like AirTel and Vodafone are failing in their legal obligations under the Information Technology Act, hastily
 amended in the days immediately following the Mumbai 7/11 attacks, by not providing
 access to the content of emails and texts sent to or from BlackBerry
 users.  As a lawyer, I have some doubt about this legal position, no
 doubt under discussion between GoI and the service providers.  But there is no
 doubt that the Government has failed to make clear the context of
 this dispute, or the real consequences of the demands it is making.</p>


<p>BlackBerry devices use the wireless networks of the local service providers to
 deliver email and texts through servers operated by Research in Motion
 located outside India.  If you or I as individuals buy a BlackBerry
 through one of the offering service providers, our email and text traffic will
 not be encrypted, and GoI will have whatever access to our
 communications the law requires.  If, however, your BlackBerry was
 given to you as an employee of an MNC or a large local enterprise, for
 work use, those emails and texts will be encrypted so that only the
 sender and receiver, but not Research in Motion (RIM) and not the local Indian wireless
 service provider, will be able to read them.  Since these parties do not have access to the content of encrypted messages, and
 therefore cannot provide what Government says the Act requires, the
 Government now threatens to force a halt to their services as of
 August 31.</p>



<p>Unless a ring of terrorists is embedded entirely within some MNC, and
 is using its email and messaging system to plan terrorist attacks or other
 crimes using corporate BlackBerries, such a service cut would not be
 likely to prevent the planning or execution of any attacks.  What it
 would do, however, is effectively cut off India from the global
 financial system.  The ability of banks, insurance companies, law
 firms, consultancies and other professional service enterprises to
 operate around the globe depends entirely on the flow of confidential intra-firm communications.
 People cannot do business anywhere unless they can be sure that their
 firm's business communications are not being overheard by competitors
 or other parties using breaches in communications networks.  So
 every such enterprise relies upon mechanisms that ensure complete
 confidentiality on which the movement of trillions of crores every day
 in the world economy depend.  BlackBerry provides one portion of that
 network to a large subset of that market.  Any country which shuts
 off encrypted BlackBerry communications has shut down its place in the
 global economy.</p>



<p>Government knows, what the extent of its threat implies if our connection with the global economy is

temporarily lost.  But if the Government were clear with the public now about the small security benefit to gain
 and the magnitude of the harm  it will cause if its threat is carried out, its dis-proportionality would raise questions in the mind of the public. Apparently GoI believes that such a threat can, from its very desperate
 dramatic quality, induce a useful result.
 Unfortunately, this too is wrong.  Because nobody but the enterprises themselves have an access to the decrypted information, Government must get inside the BlackBerry itself if it is to read the messages.</p>


</p>Thus, it is likely that GoI is pressurizing the local service providers like Airtel and Vodafone to put spyware within the
 BlackBerries attached to their networks. Thus, an arriving investment
 banker or CEO from New York or Frankfurt would have his BlackBerry
 subject to the introduction of spyware by the network, along with all
 the BlackBerries used by Indian financial services firms.  There is
 precedent for this effort.  One UAE wireless company, Etisalat, was
 caught installing spyware on more than 100,000 enterprise BlackBerries
 in the Emirates last year.  Research in Motion was required by its
 customers to bear the cost of software upgrades to the system to
remove the spyware and secure their business communications.  Etisalat
 has been fundamentally injured in its credibility in international
 business, and is in some danger of becoming a global pariah.</p>



<p>GoI is making threats that could only be fulfilled at
 cataclysmic cost to the economy. It will in effect result in causing immense harm to India's telecommunications sector and our
 reputation in the global financial services economy, where so many of
 our jobs are being created. In the end, it would inflict immense damage, much greater than any terrorist could ever cause scarcely achieving any
 additional security.</p>

language contain unintelligible nonsense—the perfect weapon to use

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"> 	So what will the
status of software patents be going forward?   Given the Supreme
Court’s reluctance to categorically exclude any type of invention
from patent-eligibility in the face of unforeseen developments in
technology, I believe that at least some forms of software will
remain patentable, barring any (unlikely) legislative response to the
software patent issue. 

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"> 	Expect to see
software patent claims for “computer readable mediums” encoded
with “processor executable instructions” challenged under the
machine-or-transformation test as not being tied to a specific
machine. These challenges may prove successful in invalidating the
most abstract of computer software patents, to which patent
applicants will respond by drafting process claims with ever
increasing references to specific computer hardware. I also expect to
see an increasing reliance on system claims with generic hardware
elements, such as a processor or computer network, configured to
perform steps performed in software. The  patentability question for
computer software running on general-purpose computers will be
decided on the Court’s clear disfavor for “abstract ideas” as
seen in the context of the reaffirmed <I>Benson</I>-<I>Flook</I>-<I>Diehr</I>
trilogy of Supreme Court cases. The language in these cases which
deny patents to “algorithms” and “mental processes” may prove
useful in invalidating the most harmful of software patents.</P>

<p>This weekend marks the 300th anniversary of the Statute of Anne, widely considered to be the foundation of modern copyright law. The Statute, formally titled “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning," is often praised for placing intellectual property rights in the hands of individual authors and ushering in the era of public interest copyright law. In reality, however, the law's most lasting legacy has been the misguided proposition that “the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write useful Books" cannot be accomplished without copyright: a system which restricts the flow and use of information, chills collaboration, and presupposes that property rights are necessary to encourage innovation.</p>

<p>The passage of the Statute represents the culmination of a centuries-long partnership between the monarchy and publishers, the effects of which continue to be felt today. In 16th century England, religious and political unrest, coupled with the proliferation of printed media, threatened to compromise the crown's ability to control the masses. Queen Mary and King Philip engineered a clever media censorship scheme in response. In 1556 they struck a Machiavellian deal with the guild of London publishers: the publishers would cooperate with the crown to prevent the publication of undesirable works, and in exchange, the crown would grant them a monopoly over intellectual property rights and the power to destroy unlawful books and presses.</p>

</p>By the end of the 17th century, this partnership lapsed, threatening the publishers' monopoly. The publishers tried repeatedly to reinstitute the scheme, but amidst the growing importance of the electorate and an increasing hostility to private monopolies, all their efforts failed. The publishers had to change their strategy. If they were unable to reestablish copyright all for themselves, the next best thing for them would be to assign property rights directly to authors, who, unable to print and distribute their works on their own, would have no choice but to contract with the publishers. Publishers could then bargain with the authors to get exclusive publication rights, in essence perpetuating their monopoly over books.</p>

<p>With this goal in mind, the publishers convinced Parliament that the creation of strong intellectual property rights was essential to encourage the advancement of learning.</p>

<p>So the Statute of Anne was born, and on April 10, 1710, became law. The Statute of Anne, which, like modern copyright, granted exclusive rights directly to authors for limited terms, was intended by Parliament to promote “the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write useful Books.” Intellectual property, which restricts individuals' use of each other's ideas, had formerly always been conceived as a tool of censorship. That it was now suddenly championed as a tool to encourage information sharing denotes nothing less than a radical shift and is testament to the success of the publishers in convincing Parliament that no one does anything for free.</p>

</p>This unfounded presumption that is now so deeply ingrained in modern conceptions of intellectual property, is the unfortunate legacy of the Statute of Anne. Hence the misguided challenge posed to the FLOSS movement with frustrating frequency: How can Free Software possibly provide adequate incentives to developers in the absence of strong proprietary intellectual property rights? Of course, our model does work. The fundamental flaw informing this question lies not in the shortcomings of the collaborative innovation model, but in the ancient assumption that only property rights can provide an effective incentive to write and publish.</p>

<p><em>[Crossposted
  from <a href="http://opensource.com/law/10/4/gene-patenting-and-free-software-breakthrough">Opensource.com</a>].</em></p>

<p>Last week, to the surprise of patent lawyers and the biotechnology industry, advocates for technological freedom won an enormous victory against socially harmful distortions of patent law.  The Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York held invalid patents owned by Myriad Genetics on diagnostic testing for genetic susceptibility to the most common hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer.  By "patenting" the right to determine whether the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are present in the relevant mutated form in a women's genome, Myriad Genetics has been able to exclude all other laboratories from conducting the test.  Patients and their insurers have paid much more, and women and their families have waited crucial weeks longer than necessary for information relevant to treatment and potentially affecting survival.</p> 

<p>The Public Patent Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the patent on the ground that the Act does not permit the patenting of "facts of nature."  <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-3-29-AMPvUSPTO-Opinion.pdf">In a lengthy and carefully argued opinion</a> granting summary judgment, Judge Robert Sweet agreed. Judge Sweet rejected the basic premise on which gene testing patents such as the one granted to Myriad have been justified: that the amplification of naturally-occurring DNA sequences is a patentable transformation of the DNA molecule.  Instead, Judge Sweet adopted the view put forward by Myriad's own expert witnesses, that DNA is a special molecule, "a physical carrier of information," and therefore held that the reading of such naturally-occurring information is not patentable subject matter.  Whether posed as a new composition of matter, or as a method for "analyzing" or "comparing" DNA sequences, Judge Sweet held, Myriad's attempt to gain a monopoly on looking at a particular DNA sequence to find out what it says falls outside the permissible scope of patent law.</p>

<p>In reaching his legal conclusions, Judge Sweet relied significantly on the recent opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has primary responsibility for interpreting the nation's patent law, <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2009/bilski-resources.html">In re Bilski, 535 F.3d 943 (2008)</a>, now pending in the Supreme Court. Bilski, as readers here will know, raises issues concerning the patentability of business methods and computer software, on essentially the same basic ground: that, as the Supreme Court has said, "phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work." Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972).  Judge Sweet's opinion may be said to raise the stakes on Bilski slightly, but the parts of the Federal Circuit opinion on which Judge Sweet relies are not about the "specialized machine or transformation of matter" test adopted by the Federal Circuit to distinguish patentable from unpatentable inventions involving computer software and methods of doing business. Judge Sweet followed the Federal Circuit closely in its expression of the settled law of patent scope, making it more unlikely that the Federal Circuit, which will hear the inevitable appeal from Judge Sweet's judgment, will be inclined to disturb the conclusion.</p>

</p>Instead, Judge Sweet's ruling shows the beginning of a broader front in the judicial determination to reign in patenting that has gone too far, turning information that should be free to all into property exclusively held by a few.  Neither our patent law itself, nor the guarantees of freedom to learn and teach protected by the First Amendment, can tolerate the widespread creation of statutory monopolies on ideas.  Judge Sweet's conclusion with respect to gene patenting confirms and supports the position taken by the amici curiae in Bilski, <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2009/bilski-amicus-brief.html">including the Software Freedom Law Center</a>, that computer software standing by itself, another carrier of information about algorithms, or mental processes, is not within the scope of patent law.  Judge Sweet's opinion illuminates another of the large classes of human knowledge presently being made the subject of statutory monopolies through the patent system, but which cannot legally be made monopolies at all.</p>

<p>Americans have begun to understand a little bit about how, in the last two decades, corporations and their servants turned more and more of our society's opportunities into property for themselves.  The sorrow and anger that is entering our politics, as honorable working people realize how badly they were had, will not soon abate.  That the patent system too was gamed by the powerful at the expense of everybody else has not been fully grasped yet.  But it will be.  Time will show that Judge Sweet was more than courageous in his ruling, that he was also speaking with the voice of America behind him, as all great judges do.</p>
